Description: Counts occurrences of motifs in bipartite networks, as well as the number of
    times each node or link appears in each unique position within motifs. Has support for both
    binary and weighted motifs: can calculate the mean weight of motifs and the standard deviation 
    of their mean weights. Intended for use in ecology, but its methods are general and can be
    applied to any bipartite network.
