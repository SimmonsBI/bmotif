1.0.0.9000
=====
## Major changes
- positions() function has been renamed node_positions() to allow node_positions and the upcoming link_positions() function to be distinguished
- mcount 'normalise' argument has been renamed 'normalistion' for consistency with positions()

## Minor changes
- Changed default row and column names to lower-case; added information on default row and column names to documentation; removed warning if default row and column names are assigned
- Updated README with citation, license and references section. Added links to MATLAB and Python versions
- Added bioRxiv preprint citation in CITATION file

## Bug fixes
- Fixed bug where positions() (now called node_positions()) would break for 1 x 1 matrices when using 'sum' or 'size class' normalisation

1.0.0
