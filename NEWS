1.0.0.9000
=====
## Major changes
- New function: link_positions(). Counts the number of times each link in a network occurs in each unique link position within motifs up to 6 nodes (to quantify a link's structural role).
- positions() function has been renamed node_positions() to allow node_positions and the link_positions() function to be distinguished
- Column names in node_position() function are changed from px to npx, where x is the ID of the position. This is to distinguish node positions (np) from link positions (lp) in the link_positions() functions
- mcount 'normalise' argument has been renamed 'normalistion' for consistency with node_positions()

## Minor changes
- Changed default row and column names to lower-case; added information on default row and column names to documentation; removed warning if default row and column names are assigned
- Updated README with citation, license and references section. Added links to MATLAB and Python versions
- Added bioRxiv preprint citation in CITATION file
- Some minor documentation updates to node_positions()
- Added a new author of the package

## Bug fixes
- Fixed bug where positions() (now called node_positions()) would break for 1 x 1 matrices when using 'sum' or 'size class' normalisation

1.0.0
=====
- mcount() counts the number of motifs up to 6 nodes in a bipartite network.
- positions() counts the number of times each node in a bipartite network occurs in each unique position in each of the motifs up to 6 nodes.
